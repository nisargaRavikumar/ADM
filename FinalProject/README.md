## Introduction
Goodreads was established with the intention of getting people excited about reading. In order to exhilarate people, they need to be made aware of exciting books. Consequently, entitling them to read it and share their experiences with others. 

We all have faced the disappointment of not so helpful suggestions about books from the author we love. A good recommendation system comes a long way with helping us find good books. 

The recommendation system that we have built in this project combines multiple algorithms to analyze a myriad number of data points to provide excellent recommendations about the book that the user might be interested in reading next. It lays out a connection between books and users by how often they come under the same bookshelves and whether the same people loved reading it.


## Objectives
1. Building recommendation system for the users which will recommend the similar books on the basis of book ratings

2. To give 5 books recommendations based on the users interested books 

3. Using Historical data performing the Cohort Analysis for user retention

4. Forecasting the inventory stock filling based on the frequency of userâ€™s order in any given location

5. Rating prediction based on the similarity of the user

6. To build a simple web application to show the recommendations to the users
